Abstract
This article discusses the information representation process based on the Moscovici’s Social Representation Theory and domain
analysis in Information Science. The aim was to identify mechanisms and constituent dimensions of social representation in
collaborative tagging systems/social bookmarking systems. Scientific knowledge was defined as the object/phenomenon of
representation in these systems; and the tag as the shareable structure of meaning that connects participants and resources. The
empirical research involved descriptive statistical techniques applied to a corpora of tags available in CiteULike, which is a social
tagging system developed for the academic community. The data analysis, performed in a sample of groups derived from the
dataset, showed that the users’ reuse of their own tags resembles the anchorage mechanism. The reuse of tags by other participants
- in the same group - reveals some evidence of the objectification mechanism. Some speculation arose about the cognitive effort
made by the individual, under group influence, with regard to the tagging activity, user’s choice of resources, and sharing styles.
Further studies on social bookmarking systems depend both on a “gain scale” of users and items tagged, requiring techniques and
procedures redesigned by Information Science, Statistics, Network Analysis, Linguistics/Sociolinguistics and Social Psychology.

Resumo
O artigo discute um recorte na temática de representação da informação explorando a Teoria das Representações Sociais e a abordagem da análise de domínio da Ciência da Informação. Teve como objetivo geral identificar mecanismos e dimensões constituintes da
representação social em grupos de participantes de sistemas de colaborativos de marcação (ou sistemas de marcação social). Definiu-se o conhecimento científico como objeto/fenômeno de representação em tais sistemas; delimitou-se a tag/marcação como unidade
de registro e de significado; e se considerou os usuários, o conjunto total de tags, e os itens marcados como unidade de contexto. A
pesquisa empírica envolveu técnicas de estatística descritiva aplicada à corpora de tags disponíveis em datasets do CiteULike - um
sistema de marcação social orientado para a comunidade científico-acadêmica. A análise dos dados em uma amostra de grupos

Introduction

could be exposed and analyzed with the help of
Psychology, Sociology, and Linguistics theories.

Environments mediated by technology have led
to the increasing autonomy of individuals in the process
of information representation. Within this context, a set
of applications - known as collaborative tagging systems
or social bookmarking systems - aim to stimulate a
“shared” effort to find and tag items in a joint collection
of resources. The tags, which can be words, phrases, codes
or other strings of characters, may either represent the
features of the tagged resources (or resource-tagger
relationships), as well as become representations or
descriptions that can be used by search services, allowing
people to find resources that are of interest to them at
particular times (Furner, 2007).

This study was based on Moscovici’s Social
Representation Theory (SRT) (1978, 2009). According to
the SRT and Information Science, language and
communication patterns are indicators of cooperation
processes among individuals who share a given domain
of knowledge, discipline or environment (Hjørland, 2002).
By including SRT to the discussions related to social
tagging systems, three premises have been established:
1) a given individual/user, who has his own reference
framework, assumes a dynamic and dialectical
relationship with the group she/he is involved with
through the tagging activity; 2) by adopting a social
software, an individual conveys elements and dimensions
that shape the social representation of “knowledge as an
object/phenomenon”; 3) the tag is a shareable structure
of meaning among social software users.

P.Z. MARCHIORI et al.

The nature of this subject encourages studies on
recommendation systems based on information
resources selected by non-expert individuals, as well as
research that explores modeling algorithms protocols
related to disambiguation of words/terms used as tags
(or the tagging activity itself ). Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD) involves the association of a given
word (in a text or discourse) with a definition or meaning/
sense which is distinguishable from other meanings that
could be potentially given to such a word.
Disambiguation must involve the step of gathering all
the different meanings for every word relevant to the text
(or discourse under consideration) and assigning the
appropriate word (which carries the intended meaning)
to each occurrence and, therefore, excluding the nonsignificant ones (Ide & Véronis, 1998). Another approach
defies the concept of “social” in these systems as it seeks
to describe and explain the individuals’ strategies when
selecting the resources available on the Internet and their
assumptions when choosing a term for this
representation. Within this approach, it is assumed that
conceptual statements - potentially epistemic and not
always explicit - conceal a hidden set of dynamics that
TransInformação, Campinas, 26(1):27-37, jan./abr., 2014

The possibility of extracting implicit information
from datasets (corpora) of tags, in which the actual
“tagging effort” cannot be directly scrutinized, emerged
with the purpose of identifying, in social bookmarking
systems, how a community or scientific domain unveils
the mechanisms and dimensions that constitute a
(shared) social representation. The paper also intends to
offer inputs to the field of multidisciplinary analysis, as
well as in the visualization and analysis of large and
complex network studies. Furthermore, the association
of the socio-cognitive sciences and computational
modeling, such as cognitive architecture and social
simulation, can be explained from the SRT standpoint
(Sun, 2006).
Searching for patterns in tags: Users,
communities and sharing
According to Vander Wal (2005), the tagging
activity can be seen as a “narrow folksonomy” that

Irrespective of the nature of folksonomy, some
inaccuracies such as typos, lack of plural/singular control,
and the presence of lexical and grammatical variants are
inherent to any tagging activity (Guy & Tonkin, 2006). In
addition, a potential communal benefit arising from social
tagging systems depends on a high level of accumulation
and overlap of “units of interest” (users, information
resources, or tags). Another challenge refers to the
increasing flow of new resources on the Web and the
[low] probability that the same resource is likely to be
tagged by more users and that a significant amount will
be found by others (Oh, 2008).
Additionally, it is argued that a bookmarking
system receives the adjective “social” merely because the
tagging activity is easily done by using a “social software”,
which is a term that simply means the asynchronous and
collective distribution of [any] kind of knowledge (Boeije
et al., 2009). This is the antithesis of a previous statement
from Golder and Huberman (2006) who claim that such
systems actually stimulate associative movements
among their users and help them establish groups.
With regard to the roles of information sharing
undertaken by individuals, Talja (2002) divides the
academic community into four groups - super-sharers,
sharers, occasional sharers, and non-sharers - depending
on the extent and intent in which participants engage in
collective searching and information exchange activities.
Although the original empirical data was collected from

communities-of-practice, Talja (2002, p.4) identifies the
following types of information sharing:
a) Strategic: information sharing as a conscious
strategy to maximize efficiency in a research
group;
b) Paradigmatic: information sharing as a means
of establishing a novel and distinguishable
research approach or area within a discipline or
across disciplines;
c) Directive: information sharing between
professors and students; and
d) Social: information sharing as a relationshipand community-building activity.

Talja (2002), and previously Haythornthwaite and
Wellman (1998), address their conclusions in agreement
with the critiques made by some designers who create
technology-intensive information systems. According to
those designers, individuals are seen as socially
disembodied, i.e., by disregarding issues such as “[…]
power, gender, socioeconomic status, differential
resources, or complex bundles of interactions and
alliances” (Haythornthwaite & Wellman, 1998, p.1102).
However, Furnas et al. (2006) take into account
that a set of resources tagged by different people (with a
particular tag in common) represents a collective image
of these resources as they are understood by that
community. This argument allows the connection to
social theories.
Social Representation Theory: Dimensions and
constituent processes
The dynamics of group exchanges - as in a social
class or in a given culture - makes “familiar the unfamiliar”,
which allows consensus, creation of knowledge and,
therefore, the construction of social representations
(Moscovici, 1978).
Under the influence of those specific collective
“choirs”, or an unique universe of discourse, Moscovici
(1978) identifies, for members of a given community,
three dimensions that shape the concept of
representation and provide content and meaning to
what is represented. In addition, given the social
characteristic of the process, these dimensions set “[...]
social boundaries separating groups” (Santos, 1994, p.136,

reinforces one’s Personal Information Management (PIM)
allowing a certain individual to identify and classify an
information resource using his/her own vocabulary. This
kind of tagging action is dominant on Flickr, where a
person or a few people apply a group of tags to retrieve
one (or more) specific resource(s). On the other hand,
even if a person involved in the tagging process uses
terms derived from his/her own vocabulary in
collaborative tagging (or “broad folksonomy”), there are
more people tagging the same object/resource. A power
curve (or a network effect) comes forth as a result to the
number of persons involved in the tagging activity such
as in Delicious. Therefore, collaborative tagging has
required wider debates and a more significant amount
of empirical studies concerning the possibilities of
promoting access/resource discovery and knowledge
organization (Vander Wal, 2005).

our translation)5, being defined as follows (Moscovici,
1978; Alves-Mazzotti, 1994, Santos, 1994):
a) Information: is related to the organization,
quantity and quality of knowledge that a group has about
an object;
b) Field of representation: refers to the idea of an
image, a social model, and a concrete and limited body
of propositions related to a particular aspect of what is
being represented. It implies a hierarchical set of
elements, formulated judgments, claims and some sort
of arrangement; and
c) Attitude: exposes the overall orientation
towards the object of social representation, usually on
two opposite points (favorable, unfavorable), or even by
intermediate positions between these extremes. It is a
preconceived opinion rooted in group relationships, as
well as the reorganization and reshuffling of the
individual’s experience concerning the object.
The term “object” requires further clarification.
Although not all things can be included in the Theory,
Marková (2006, p.202, our translation)6 states that:
[…] any object or phenomenon, irrespective of
being physical (a kitchen), interpersonal
(friendship), mythological (the Loch Ness
monster) or socio-political (democracy), can
become an object of social representation [...].
[The] Social Representation and Communication
Theory considers any kind of representation. It
peruses and builds theories about those social
phenomena that have become, for no specific
reason, a public concern. These phenomena,
which are investigated and discussed, are those
that ignite tension and trigger a reaction.

30

This investigation understands scientific
knowledge - encapsulated as resources/items available
on the Internet - as a social phenomenon and, therefore,
as a latent object of social representation. When the
representation process starts, the individuals’ reference
5

framework (their values and classification structures) is
sustained by the social/group rules, both from an
objective and subjective standpoint of the “object”
(Moscovici, 1978). Such reference framework and group
rules underpin the two fundamental mechanisms of SRT:
anchoring and objectification.
Anchoring is:
[a] process that arises our curiosity and alters
something troublesome and unfamiliar in our
particular system of categories and fits it to a
paradigm of a category that we consider
appropriate [...]. When a certain object or idea is
compared with the paradigm of a category, it
acquires characteristics from that category and it
is readjusted to fit it [...]. Anchoring is, therefore,
to classify and name something (Moscovici, 2009,
p.61, our translation)7.

Anchoring happens at the private domain of
comparisons, interpretations and categorizations, while
objectification takes place in a given community/group
by the transition of such concepts or ideas to schemes
or to concrete images which - by the generality of their
use and overall consensus - become would-be reflections
of reality (Alves-Mazzotti, 1994).
Objectification has two essential movements:
naturalization, which sets the imagined into the cognitive;
and classification, which organizes and fixes in scope such
stimuli and arranges them, preferably, to a pre-existing
schema, i.e., into a socially defined framework. The
classification conveys the unfamiliar to a familiar domain
placing the object within a defined context, “[...] which
means to add a label to those that are already in use, to
broaden the existing class tree” (Moscovici, 1978, p.131,
our translation)8, or to assign or not (to the object) the
characteristics of a given category.
According to Moscovici (2009), a figurative
nucleus arises from those mechanisms, and it is assumed
as being a structure of images that reproduces a

“[...] linhas sociais de separação de grupos”.
“[...] qualquer objeto ou fenômeno, independente de ser físico (uma cozinha), interpessoal (amizade), imaginário (o monstro do Lago Ness) ou sociopolítico
(democracia), pode se transformar em um objeto de uma representação social [...]. [A] Teoria das Representações Sociais e da Comunicação estuda tipos específicos
de representações. Ela estuda e constrói teorias a respeito daqueles fenômenos sociais que se tornaram, sem uma razão específica, o alvo da preocupação pública.
Estes fenômenos que são pesquisados e discutidos, são fenômenos que causam tensão e provocam ações”.
7
“[...] um processo que transforma algo estranho e perturbador, que nos intriga, em nosso sistema particular de categorias e o compara com um paradigma de uma
categoria que nós pensamos ser apropriada [...]. No momento em que determinado objeto ou ideia é comparado ao paradigma de uma categoria, adquire
características dessa categoria e é reajustado para que se enquadre nela [...]. Ancorar é, pois, classificar e dar nome a alguma coisa”.
8
“[...] o que equivale a juntar uma etiqueta às que já são utilizadas, a diversificar a árvore das classes já existentes”.

As Moscovici recognizes the mediating force of
language so do Talja et al. (2005). According to these
authors, the constructionist metatheory evokes language
and mediation driving components to contemporary
studies on information retrieval and knowledge
organization. The Constructionist Theory perceives the
language as having a significant role in the social
construction of “meaning” through the notions of
discourse, utterances and vocabularies. Within this theory,
the concept of cognition is replaced by conversations;
and a conversation is recognized as a sine qua non
condition for the constitution of the social world,
knowledge, and identities (Talja et al., 2005).

Methods
Understanding the tag as the “discourse” structure,
it was defined as a unit of register (or an entity of meaning)
related to “[...] a content segment considered as the basic
unit to be categorized and counted” (Bardin, 2010, p.130,
our translation)9. In order to organize and perceive the
meaning of the unit of register Bardin (2010) establishes
the concept of registration unit. In a collaborative tagging
system, the context unit has three dimensions: the whole
set/corpora of tags; the set of items tagged; and users/
taggers.
The context units were obtained (free of charge)
from datasets provided by a social tagging system aimed
to promote and develop the sharing of scientific
references among researchers <http://www.citeulike.
org>. This database, covering the period from 2006 to
March 2012, was processed in MS-SQLTM Server 2008 to
exclude non-valid data and identify unique resources/
items, tags and users.
9
10

This process of exclusion resulted in a countable
set of 16,941,749 lines, each corresponding to an input
tag per resource/item and per user. From those sets of
lines, the ones that had the following contents were
excluded: no-tag, *file-import%, imported% and bibteximport. Lines containing numbers were discarded
keeping only the numbers ‘2’ and ‘3’ to avoid the exclusion
of terms such as ‘2D’ and ‘3D’. Any line containing a tag
with less than two characters (a letter, a symbol) was also
excluded. The final set, hereafter referred to as “research
data”, consisted of 14,895,884 lines in which 2,744,129
univocal items were identified, 717,928 were unique tags,
and 72,097 were unique users.
Another step of adjustment of the research data
helped to establish relations between identification (id)
of the item posted/tagged with the unique code given
to each user; the code that identifies the groups in which
each user participates; and the tag(s) defined by the
user(s) as a result of the tagging/posting activity.
The presence or absence of tags offers the
possibility to apply a quantitative (statistical) approach
and a measurement of weights. Thus, when considering
the methods proposed by Bardin (2010), we chose to
adapt the “relationship analysis technique”. In this
technique, the frequency of appearance of the tags
(registration units/entities of meaning) is “[...] based on the
principle that the higher the frequency of the elements,
the greater their importance, [and] the co-occurrence (or
non-co-occurrence) of two or more elements [reveals]
an association or a dissociation process in the mind of
the speaker” (Bardin, 2010, p.258, our translation)10. In the
present research, the co-occurrence shall mean that a
given tag is used by one (or more) different user(s) to
categorize an item; equivalence indicates that one (or
more) similar tag(s) is used by different users to name
different items; and association means that different
tag(s) is used by different users to identify a given item.
Based on the research data, the following groups
of users were identified, as shown in Table 1.
More than half the users (69.11%) did not
participate in any group and 2.77% of users belonged as

“[...] ao segmento de conteúdo a considerar como unidade de base, visando à categorização e a contagem frequencial”.
“[...] assenta no princípio de que quanto maior for a frequência dos elementos, maior será a sua importância [e] a coocorrência (ou a não coocorrência) de dois ou
mais elementos [revela] a associação ou dissociação no espírito do locutor”.

composite of ideas, which are revealed by the words that
(often) express those ideas. The presence of the figurative
nucleus strengthens the role of language in the SRT. In
fact, there is a correspondence between the most
frequently used words of a language and the core themes
inferred from the figurative nucleus, which establishes a
relationship between the language and the social
representation.

sole individuals in their own groups. The data is in
agreement with the study of Pfeiffer et al. (2008) who
claim that, in any system shaped for the scientificacademic community, the tagging activity is effective
only for private purposes. Roughly one third of the
registered groups (31.77%) had about two to four
members, which reinforces the research of Wheelan
(2009) concerning the productivity of small groups.
Considering the proposal to identify the elements
and dimensions of SRT in a “social space” (though virtual),
the research data was reduced to select some groups for
in-depth analysis. The groups containing users who
participated in these groups only and who had articles/
items tagged were maintained for further analysis. We
chose this procedure to prevent possible bias that could
occur if the user was associated with more groups and
the same item (or tag) from being posted in distinct
groups. As a result, one hundred groups were found, 1,117
unique users and 740,562 items. About 55% of these
groups contained only one or two users.

When ordering the list of groups by number of
users, it was found that the amount of users was recurrent
from the sixth group on (eight users), which made it
difficult to define consistent criteria for further cutbacks.
Therefore, we chose to analyze only the six groups with
a larger number of members. These groups were listed
in descending order from the total of taglines of each
user (Table 2).
Of these six groups, three - with more items and
tags (G159TU21, G264TU15 and G238TU16) - were
isolated and the following procedures were applied:
a) Verification, user to user, of reuse of own tags
within the period of existence of the group (reuse was
calculated by the frequency of use of tag(s));
b) Exclusion, user by user, of duplicate items;
c) Exclusion, user by user, of duplicate tags in
order to generate the set of unique tags. No word sense
disambiguation procedure was used;
d) Pointing out, user by user, the existence of
equivalent tags;

f ) For shared tagging activity (involving more
than one user), the quantity of items, the number of tags
and unique tags, total of items per user (and their
percentages regarding the total of items) were verified.
The aim of the analysis was to evaluate the reuse
of tags by the same user, as an indicator of the anchoring
mechanism, and reuse of tags by other users of the group
as an indicator of the objectification mechanism. We
sought for evidence of figurative nucleus and the
following SRT dimensions: information, field of
representation and attitude, assuming that these are the
ones that provide content and meaning to what is
represented.

Results and Discussion
Of the three groups selected for analysis,
G159TU21 showed constant activity for six years and
there were eight active members (Table 3). Since a code
was automatically created to identify each user in the
original dataset, the last four characters of this code were
used to make reference to a given user.
Three of the eight members of the group
contributed with 83.46% of total unique tags and 581
items (88.30%). Of the three, the user ‘1975’ and the user
‘a1b8’ showed 82.00% of reuse. The percentage of reuse
was calculated using the following formula:

TU
) *100.00% . Several anomalies were

found in the group’s set of tags, such as the use of symbols
(asterisk) [*diss; *rulewalker]; junction terms
[cluseringgene], use of symbols for junction terms
[analysis_tool; assembly-quality], use of plural/singular
[classifier; classifiers], existence of misspellings [alignlent];
symbols indicating hierarchies [essemble; essemble_
clustering; essemble_network] and functional tags
[to_read]. The functional tags represent, according to
Golder and Huberman (2006), an action intended or
carried out by the individual who performs the tagging
activity. This action can refer to the organization or the
performance of a task, for example. The monitoring of
the tagging activity showed that the users had not used
affective tags - usually adjectives - as defined by Lu et al.
(2010), which convey affective or judgmental utterances.

The co-occurrence of tags among items tagged
in common was identified among six of the eight
members of the group with the highest incidence among
users who could be considered super-sharers. In fact,
users ‘1975’ and ‘a1b8’ tagged 24 items in common with
15 co-occurrences of tags (assembly; alignment;
breakpoint; human). These two users also shared a
common item that was linked by the co-occurrence of
the tag human. Another pattern identified was a cluster
between users ‘ddf2’ and ‘6a75’, who shared four items,
with the co-occurrence of two tags (eqtl; malaria) for one
of the items. Users ‘ddf2’ and ‘9df0’ shared an item
using a tag which displays a plural/singular anomaly

also used for another item/resource tagged by three users
(‘a1b8’; ‘ddf2’ and ‘1975’). This item was tagged again
by another user in the same cluster (user ‘6a75’) but using
another tag. There were also three clusters by association
in which two or more users tagged the same resource,
but with different tags. In this case, user ‘ddf2’ was the
only one who showed up in those clusters. Another
cluster with three users (‘a1b8’, ‘6a75’ and ‘1975’)
tagged one item in common. Users ‘6a75’ and ‘1975’
assigned the tag comparisons and comparative,
respectively, which indicated a “variation of the word”
anomaly.
Even if other users were less active, the
movements of construction, communication and
relationship among the individuals, identified this group
as having a “social sharing style” (Talja, 2002).
The analysis of the G264TU15 revealed a
distinguished characteristic, which was at first considered
as a coincidence: the task-oriented search for Internet
resources within a given period was divided among the
thirteen participants (Table 4).
The dynamics of the tagging activity
demonstrated that some rules were probably defined by
the participants, except for two users. It followed a pattern
of ten unique items tagged per participant. There was
also evidence of the establishment of another pattern
for the number of tags per user (total ratio of tags and

unique tags). In this case, however, it might be a
coincidence. Even so, the search pattern and input of
items on the system is not negligible. There was no
evidence of the existence of super-sharer users and we
observed that the whole group activity lasted two
months.
No items were tagged by more than one user,
even if a significant degree of equivalence of tags was
identified, i.e., identical tags were used by different group
members. In this particular group, the participants
probably cut and pasted parts of text/title/abstract into
the system’s text box. These actions led to the appearance
of “noise” in the set of tags such as definite/indefinite
articles and connectives. The group seemed to have
adopted a strategic sharing style, i.e., to increase or
maximize the efficiency of a given task (Talja, 2002).
The G238TU16 group had nine members and one
of the participants (‘7e4e’) was identified as a super-sharer,
contributing with 80.97% of the tags in the group and
79.69% of the total items tagged. This user was the only
one who showed consistent tagging activity throughout
the group’s existence (which lasted three years) (Table
5).
There were no items tagged in common among
members of this group, but we found the equivalence
of tags in a couple of cases: two tags were used by two
users [politics] (or three, if the disambiguation of policy is

accepted). The tag feminism was used by two users and
two participants were connected by the terms (and
junction terms) [social_networks; socialnetworking]. Three
participants used terms with semantic closeness
[minority_youth; youth_cultures; [y]oung_people; youth].
The presence of this super-sharer corresponds to the
“directive style” as the social behavior of the group. This
kind of behavior is prevalent during activities of professors

indicate the presence of the objectification mechanism.
Some tag reuse was perceived, in fact, to occur among
users themselves. But, when it occurred between users,
it took place extensively and more explicitly only in
subgroups involving two users/researchers. What could
be identified as objectification, however, may also be the
result of decreased cognitive effort, in which the ease of
use of a previously submitted tag in the system does not
require new attempts by another user.

Final Considerations

Regarding the other dimensions of the Social
Representation Theory, the defined dataset cutbacks
allowed the analysis of some evidence, as follows.

The results - when the cutbacks were defined endorsed the research proposal. It was found that the
appropriation of the social tagging system by individuals
resulted in the tagging activity in the groups they belong.
Through tagging resources available on the Internet,
these individuals perform dynamic and dialectical
relationships in which their frame of experience is
reflected by the tag assignment, taken as a structure of
meaning that is potentially shareable with other users.
With regard to the elements and dimensions that shape
the social representation of “knowledge as an object/
phenomenon”, as defined in the scope of the
investigation, the data suggests that the reuse of one’s
own tags resembles the anchoring mechanism of the
SRT.
On the other hand, the extra SRT dimensions and
mechanisms could not be supported by the results. The
reuse of tags by participant(s) in another group can

About the SRT modeling dimension of information,
the research data showed that the following elements
helped to organize the information selected by the user:
the actual record of items; the entry of tag(s) assigned to
the item(s); and the submission of items and tags in the
group in which one participates. The social representation
component also happened in the groups analyzed, as a
result of a given item that had been tagged by different
users; different items tagged by users; and the reuse of
one’s own tags and/or tags from other users.
The modeling dimension of the field of
representation is revealed within the context of the
groups through the selection of concepts that
comprehends the subject of interest shared by the
participants and these concepts are expressed by the
total set of tags placed in the group. However, no affective
tags were identified in any of the groups’ collection of

tags. Their existence could have helped to define the
user’s “judgment/opinion” on the item(s).
As for the dimension of attitude, the data analysis
enabled to the inference about the choice of a given item
despite a variety of others available on the Internet. This
act of selection implies some degree of value by the user.
Pari passu, a given item by being tagged by another
member of the group could indicate a potentially
collective guideline concerning the “object”.
Another element of the SRT, the figurative nucleus
- understood as the use of words that most often reflect
the existence of complex consensual ideas within the
group - can be recognized by the frequency that certain
tags occur in the total set of tags collected by these
groups.
However, the research data did not allow a
complete verification on how individuals form the
groups, i.e., if the individuals know each other in the
physical environment; if they use the system just to
facilitate/comply with some activity; if the individuals do
not know each other in the real world but choose the
system to share material of interest as a result of their
activities; or if the participants join, by their own free will,
a group created by third parties. Nonetheless, it was
found that groups use the system in a variety of ways.
This group behavior can be summarized as follows:
a) Groups in which the behavior of super-sharers
do not necessarily influence the tagging activity of other
users;

36

b) The existence of [a] super-sharer(s) affects the
frequency count and, depending on the degree of reuse,
the potential stability of the tags in the group as well,
with consequences to the social bookmarking systems
as a whole;
c) A larger number of participants - within a larger
period of time - results in the reuse of items/resources
and tags (improving equivalence/reuse and cooccurrence), and;

d) The system usage with the intention of
performing a short task within a particular time frame
shows some degree of prior organization and, probably,
a common goal to be achieved.
With regard to the tags, users of social tagging
systems, when performing the tagging activity, are free
to define the word they consider representative to “tag”
the content of the resource, as well as the quantity of
tags they apply to such item, and how to write/input
them into the system. A defined set of tags establishes a
significant content description to a given resource that
can be expanded both from strengthening the tags
previously used (via reuse) and/or from another term/
tag given to the same item by another user. As a result of
this dynamic process, a given resource achieves a “gain
scale” if more users retrieve it and choose to tag it in the
system. Similarly, the same resource can be tagged again
or the same tag can be used for other items and, in short,
this scale effect would result in a repository of selected
items.
The building of a ‘critical mass of users’, i.e., the
increase in the number of participants in the system
community, seems to be an obstacle for further and more
conclusive studies focusing on social tagging.
Interactions in those systems seems to occur at different
levels (cultural, linguistic, knowledge and behavioral)
whose boundaries are not easily defined and analyses at
a single level tends to oversimplify others. Thus, further
studies on the subject and/or those that consider largescale multiuser systems would demand that domain
analysis go beyond the actions of individuals in the real
world and their epistemic communities. The interdisciplinary
and multidisciplinary relation of Information Science will
become even closer to Statistics, Network Theory,
Linguistics (and Sociolinguistics), and Social Psychology,
both in sharing and complementing the methodological
procedures and techniques, as well as through synergic
analysis.
