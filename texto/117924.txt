Abstract
The objective of this article is: a) to identify Peruvian researchers with high, medium and low impact factor according to Web of
Science and Scopus databases; b) to identify the bibliometric factor with the highest influence on h-index of Peruvian researchers;
c) to compare h-index between Web of Science and Scopus, at an individual and institutional level. Data were collected from Web
of Science and Scopus (189 Peruvian researchers, 28 institutions on Web of Science and 33 on Scopus), between September 1823, 2013. Then, institutional registries were created and linear regression analysis with stepwise procedure was run to identify
bibliometric factors with higher influence on the h-index of Peruvian researchers. Web of Science and Scopus showed interesting
simmilarities in the h-index of Peruvian academic institutions. At individual level, documents indexed in citation database had the
highest influence on the h-index. Regression model identified bibliometric factors with higher influence on the h-index of Peruvian
researchers, however further large scale studies are needed to improve external validity.

BIBLIOMETRIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH H-INDEX

Bibliometric factors associated with h-index
of Peruvian researchers with publications
indexed on Web of Science and
Scopus databases

Introduction
When it comes to measuring the influence - from
a bibliometric point of view - of individual researchers or
academic institutions, the recommended indicator is an
index proposed by the Argentinean physicist Jorge Hirsch
in 2005: Hirsch index or h-index, which is based on the
number of published papers and citations for such work.
As an example, if an author has an h-index of 5, he/she
has published, on average, five papers, each of which has
been cited in other papers at least 5 times (Hirsch, 2005).
In that sense, it is a measure that summarizes in a single
indicator the output impact of each researcher.
Based on the h-index, other indicators have been
developed (g-index, h weighted index, etc.) as
publication speed and size of the research community is
not the same across all disciplines. Because new
indicators have been criticized for their limited scope and
have not been tested as intensively as h-index,
Bibliometrics and Scientometrics specialists still base their
calculations on the index proposed by Jorge Hirsch.

Advantages and disadvantages of h-index

144

C. VÍLCHEZ-ROMÁN

The first positive aspect of the h-index is the easy
interpretation of data since a single indicator can show
the productivity and impact of the published work of a
researcher. Secondly, it is an easy-to-calculate indicator
because if you have reliable citation databases containing
the names of authors and registrated institutions properly
normalized, computation is fairly straightforward;
furthermore, in some citation databases (Web of Science
( WoS) and Scopus), the h-index is calculated
automatically. The indicator is harder to manipulate than
the impact factor (although it should be noted that all
measurements are subject to manipulation and bias)
because it is based on individual tracking of each
researcher’s academic output, which makes it a robust
indicator. Finally, it is possible to calculate different values
of expected ranges ([5 - 15], [10 - 20], etc.) for different
disciplines since the publication rate and size of the
research community differ among disciplines.
The main negative aspect is that the h-index tends
to penalize young researchers or those who are at the
beginning of their scientific careers. Researchers who
TransInformação, Campinas, 26(2):143-154, maio/ago., 2014

have more publications (i.e., senior researchers or those
with a longer careers) will have an advantage over those
who have fewer papers published (Bornmann & Daniel,
2005; Van Raan, 2006; Costas & Bordons, 2007;
Oppenheim, 2007). On the other hand, rather than a
weakness, the risk of using the Hirsch index is that some
institutions that do not have enough time or capital to
establish peer-review-based evaluation committees will
prefer to use a single indicator to evaluate the impact of
individual researchers. This trend will likely continue in
coming years as there will be: a) less skilled researchers
whose time will be more expensive; and b) more projects
submitted by a growing number of researchers with
postgraduate degrees.

Identification of high-impact researchers
and academic institutions
Due to the previous mentioned advantages, the
Hirsch index is a bibliometric indicator that has been
increasingly used by academic institutions to promote
scientific research (Abbott et al., 2010; Braun et al., 2010;
Van Noorden, 2010) to the degree that in some European
countries it has been incorporated into the national
legislation that promotes scientific and technological
development. H-index has been used to evaluate the
productivity of researchers in Biomedicine, Ecology,
Physics and Chemistry (Bornmann & Daniel, 2005; Hirsch,
2005; Kelly & Jennions, 2006; Van Raan, 2006; Bornmann
et al., 2008). When Jorge Hirsch proposed the index, he
applied it to a sample of physicists in high energy particles
and specialists in Molecular Biology and found that hindex values are related to the publication rates of each
discipline, citation patterns, as well as the size of the
research community.
In the field of Information Science, Cronin and
Meho (2006) compared the h-index obtained from WoS
and Google Scholar in a sample of 31 researchers from
the United States, taking into account the effect of selfcitations on the h-index. Both authors found a strong
correlation between h-index and total citations, but a
smaller effect of self-citations on the h-index. The range
of h-index values for this field was 5-20. When selfcitations were excluded, there was no variation in the hindex. A year later, Charles Oppenheim carried out a
http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0103-37862014000200004

However, the most interesting applications of
h-index have occurred within the context of institutional
evaluation, especially when measuring the research
impact. Within this perspective, h-index is useful as it was
conceived precisely as an indicator of impact. J. Molinari
and A. Molinari (2007) selected studies published from
1994-2003 by world-class universities in the fields of
Materials Science, Physics, Engineering, Mathematics,
Mechanics and Chemistry, and found that top universities
also obtained the highest institutional h-index in the 2006
Shanghai university ranking. With regard to the evaluation
of departments or programs, Mariana Pires Da Luz and
her team calculated the h-index for Psychiatry graduate
programs provided by Brazilian universities for studies
published by faculty members from 1998-2006. The
range of values of the institutional h-index for the six
programs was 3-15. In addition, researchers found that
the institutional h-index achieved a statistically significant
correlation with papers published in journals with impact
factor > 1 (Da Luz et al., 2008).
On the other hand, Themis Lazaridis calculated
the h-index of researchers affiliated with the departments
of Materials Science, Physics, Chemistry and Chemical
Engineering at Greek universities whose studies were
indexed in WoS (Lazaridis, 2009). From these data,
Lazaridis obtained an institutional h-index for the
graduate programs in the above-mentioned fields. The
h-index obtained was associated with the subjective
perception of the quality of these departments, although
there were slight differences in some areas. These findings
show that the Hirsch index is a suitable and valid measure
within the context of institutional evaluation. Therefore,
it can be considered as part of the bibliometric tools that
contribute to the peer-review process when it comes to
establishing the impact of research of academic
institutions engaged in scientific and technological
development.
http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0103-37862014000200004

Despite all the studies conducted since 2005, the
Hirsch index has not yet been used to analyze production
and impact within the Peruvian scientific community.
Thus, the three objectives of the study are as follows: a)
to identify Peruvian researchers with high, medium and
low impact according to WoS and Scopus databases;
b) to identify the bibliometric factor with the highest
influence on h-index of Peruvian researchers; c) to
compare h-index between WoS and Scopus at an
individual and institutional level.

Methods
Citation databases used for information collection
Given the information duplicity and lack of
standardization, Google Scholar was not considered in
the study; even it is a free academic citation database,
the problems already mentioned are not easily solved
by using a software program such as “Publish or Perish”
because names of authors and institutions still need to
be standardized, which is a time consuming job.
Web of Science: During the 1990s, WoS was heavily
criticized due to the overrepresentation of academic
production originated from English speaking countries
(Sancho, 1992; Spinak, 1996; Shrum, 1997) in comparison
with academic production from developing countries.
However, over the last past years, WoS citation indexes
(Science Citation Index, Social Science Citation Index, Arts
and Humanities Citation Index, Conference Proceedings
Citation Index and Book Citation Index) improved
coverage of non-English speaking countries, broadening
its initial representation, as more scientific production
from developing countries has been indexed (Vieira &
Gomes, 2009; Speare, 2010). For this reason, WoS was
considered as an information source for this study.
Scopus: The lack of data consistency and
overrepresentation of academic journals published by
the Elsevier group were frequently mentioned limitations
in the first evaluations of this scientific database
(Burnham, 2006; Archambault et al., 2009). In recent years,
Scopus producers have made significative improvements
by normalizing data of authors and institutions, as well
as solving previously reported gaps. Moreover, its broad

BIBLIOMETRIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH H-INDEX

similar study, but unlike the previous work, his research
focused on British researchers and used the Eugene
Garfield’s h-index, the creator of the impact factor
(Oppenheim, 2007). Oppenheim found that the h-index
value was not affected by the inclusion of citations of
publications not indexed in WoS. The range of the index
values for the British researchers in Information Science
was 6-31.

coverage (almost 19,500 peer-reviewed journals,
including more than 1,900 Open Access journals, 5.3
million conference proceedings, and over 50% of content
coming from Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific,
etc.) was the main reason for considering it as the second
information source for this study.
Data collection procedure
Web of Science: To work with updated data of
scientific production from Peru, the author searched for
studies in which the country affiliation of the researcher
was Peru (CU=Peru). The country affiliation was chosen
because WoS does not have an author registry containing
the academic profile for each researcher. For this reason,
a list of authors with an h-index equal to or greater than
three was obtained. We first intended to identify the
authors affiliated to a Peruvian research institute, based
on the previous registered data.
However, lack of a standardized registry for
authors and multiple institutional affiliations made it hard
to use this citation database for recording bibliometric
data of each individual researcher. Although there is a
software program called Thomson Data Analyzer,
designed for analyzing normalized data of authors, it is
an expensive commercial tool, which made it impossible
to use during this research. At the end, WoS was used
only to record data of institutionals (n=28). To obtain data
for each Peruvian institution, after the initial search
(CU=Peru), the “Analyze Results” option was used to group
different entries for the same institution and record them
in an Excel spreadsheet.

Scopus: we followed a similar procedure as
described for WoS. First we searched for documents with
Peru as the affiliation country (Affilcountry(Peru)), then a
list of authors with an h-index equal to or greater than
three was obtained. Concerning the multiple affiliation
data, the history of institutional data was reviewed to
decide which would be the preferred institutional
affiliation. Two criteria were taken into account: if Peruvian
institutions were mentioned at least five times or at least
20% of afiiliations mentioned a Peruvian institution in the
full list of affiliations. Bibliometric data from 189 authors
were registered in an Excel spreadsheet.
TransInformação, Campinas, 26(2):143-154, maio/ago., 2014

Given that Scopus has a standardized registry for
authors and institutions, it was not hard to obtain and
record data for individuals (n=189) and institutionals
(n=33). In case an institution did not have an institutional
profile, the “Affiliation search” option was used to find
documents affiliated with it. When the results were
displayed, the “View citation overview” tool was used to
compute the h-index for this institution. Self-citations
were not excluded when computing individual or
institutional h-index since previous studies have shown
an insignificant, almost imperceptible, effect of selfcitations on the h-index of researchers (Cronin & Meho,
2006).
Data were compiled from September 18-23, 2013;
then recorded into an Excel spreadsheet and exported
to the MLwiN program, version 2.15, which is used for
multilevel modeling. From MLwiN, the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences (SPSS) data matrix was generated
to run regression analysis.
Information collected at the end of this stage was
entered into three databases:
Scopus-individual level (seven fields): researcher’s
name, documents indexed, citations, institutional
affiliation, h-index of researcher, h-index of the selected
institutional affiliation, academic age of researcher.
WoS and Scopus institutional level (the same five
fields): name of institution, h-index, documents indexed,
citations, foundation date of academic institution.

Exploration techniques and data analysis
As previously mentioned, three datasets were
created with the bibliometric data for Peruvian
researchers and institutions, which consisted of raw data
for conducting statistical analysis of entire databases
(Scopus with individual data =189 records; WoS with
institutional data =28 records and Scopus =33 records),
the three databases are available on request.
Given that the authors could be grouped by
institutions, a multilevel analysis was considered to take
into account the data pooled to obtain a more precise
identification of the bibliometric factors associated with
the h-index of the researcher. As a previous step before
data analysis using multilevel modeling, descriptive

0 = Y1 + u0j
4 = Y2 + u1j
Note: subscript letters i y j show variation at the
individual and institutional level.
According to this formula, the h-index for each
researcher changes at the individual and institutional
level, so the intercept and regression coefficient for the
h-index of the academic institutional showed variation
at this second level. After this, the next step was to
calculate the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)
(ICC=2u0 / 2u0 + 2e) - known as partitioned variance
coefficient in the MLwiN software - and change the
model fit according to the -2-log likelihood. One hundred

BIBLIOMETRIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH H-INDEX

statistics was obtained to verify whether the data was
close to a normal curve distribution. Although in
multilevel modeling it is possible to control the effect of
skewed distributions, through a process known as
variable centering, this works well if the variables do not
have high dispersion, since the data could produce
biased analysis. Next, a correlation matrix was generated
to determine if it was appropriate to run the Ordinary
Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis first, followed by
the multilevel modeling.

and eight-nine cases were considered for the multilevel
analysis. Once the tests were finalized, data were analyzed
using a random components model. If the values of ICC
and the model fit were not appropriate, an OLS linear
regression, using the stepwise procedure, was used to
identify factors associated with the h-index of the
Peruvian researchers.

Results
Researchers with high and medium impact in the
Peruvian scientific community
Peruvian researchers with high impact factors
come from foreign universities and they publish
academic work as coauthors with other native Peruvian
scholars, which explain why the top ten researchers
appear as the six foreign authors registered in Peru as
the country of affiliation in some of their publications.
Considering the three levels of impact (high
= h-index 31, medium =30 h-index 21, low
=20 h-index), it can be observed that few researchers
(n=7) have high impact in the Peruvian scientific
community, a bigger group (n=13) has a medium impact
and the majority of Peruvian researchers has low impact
(n=169). In terms of academic age (years since the first
academic publication indexed in citation databases) not
all high impact authors are senior researchers because
two young Peruvian authors (Héctor Hugo García
and Enrique Solano) are among the top ten researchers
(Table 1).

research impact

C. VÍLCHEZ-ROMÁN

With regard to the academic institutions, only a
few of them have high research impact (6 in Wos and 6
in Scopus), while a bigger group reached a medium
research impact (10 in WoS and 14 in Scopus) and the
vast majority of institutions showed a low research
impact. Due to limited space, only the top institutions
are shown, but it must be noted that the full list of the
Peruvian institutions indexed on citation databases is
larger than the one shown in Table 2.
TransInformação, Campinas, 26(2):143-154, maio/ago., 2014

Since WoS and Scopus do not use the same
criteria for indexing academic work, we expected to find
some differences between the two databases; however,
it is important to note that among the top ten research
institutions there are seven matches, but not in same
position. Moreover, among the 20 research institutions
with the highest h-index, 17 institutions were in common,
which shows that despite their differences both citation
databases are quite similar (WoS and Scopus are used to
determine the impact of research institutions). Previous
studies have found an important similarity between the
h-index values assigned by WoS and Scopus, as shown
in studies in Information Science (Cronin & Meho, 2006).
Different factors explain the high academic
impact of universities and research institutes; for example,
in WoS, the institutional h-index was correlated with
indexed documents and academic age, whereas Scopus
associates documents, number of affiliated authors and
academic age (Table 3).
The number of affiliated authors suggests that a
research institution can not restrict itself to local authors,
but coauthorships with foreign institutions are needed
because collaborative work with other institutions
increases probability of achieving high academic visibility.
Bibliometric factors associated with
the h-index of researchers
The h-index of Peruvian researchers showed
non-biased distribution (12,053 ± 8,7615). With regard
to the institutional h-index, both WoS and Scopus
showed non-biased distribution: 24,893 ± 14,841 and
24,697 ± 12,516, respectively.
The ranges of institutional h-index ([6-75] in WoS
and [7-74] in Scopus showed high values, so a powerlaw distribution was considered the most appropriate to
represent institutional h-index values. Indeed, power
distribution confirmed that a few institutions had a high
h-index (e.g.: in WoS, the h-index for the Universidad
Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) was 74 and for the
Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM) 41).
Thus, by excluding the Universidad Peruana Cayetano
Heredia (UPCH), Universidad Nacional Mayor de San
Marcos (UNMSM), Centro Internacional de la Papa (CIP),
Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP) and Instituto

de Investigación Nutricional (IIN), most Peruvian research
institutions had a medium or low h-index. The power
distribution observed with the institutional h-index led
us to reconsider the original hypothesis because
according to the preliminary data, it was not appropriate
to run a multilevel analysis.

C. VÍLCHEZ-ROMÁN

As expected, according to theory, individual hindex achieved a strong positive correlation with
documents and citations, but a medium and weak
association with academic age and institutional h-index
(Table 4). This was the second reason for assessing the
relevance of running a multilevel modeling using
institutional h-index, given the small covariation among
variables and institutional h-index.
However, the main criterion for not running a
multilevel modeling was the calculation of the Intraclass
Correlation Coeffient (ICC). In any multilevel analysis,
TransInformação, Campinas, 26(2):143-154, maio/ago., 2014

researchers begin with simple models and progress to
more complex models. In this study, when author went
from a fixed components model to a random
components model, the ICC was very low (0.05), which
means that variance explained by multilevel modeling
was 5%. Additionally, model fit did not achieve significant
improvement, since the value of - 2-log likelihood did
not show great variation.
As shown by the preliminary analysis, since it was
inappropriate to conduct a multilevel analysis for the hindex of Peruvian researchers, a linear multiple regression
was run to identify bibliometric factor with the highest
influence on the h-index of the researcher (Table 5).
Regression coefficients of indexed documents and
citations were statistically significant (p<0.05), although
only the first one presented considerable influence. In
brief, for each new document indexed on the citation

respectively. With regard to the model fit, R2 was relatively
high (82% of explained variance).

Discussion
A first issue is that the Matthew effect appeared
both for the individual and institution: only a few scholars
have high impact publications while the majority reaches
medium- or low impact publications. This means that to
improve academic impact, Peruvian research institutions
must identify those high impact centers and develop
collaborative projects with them. Therefore, impact
rankings such as the annually published Scimago
International Report can be a valuable tool.
The second issue refers to the transnational nature
of scientific knowledge. Although the purpose of this
study was to analyze the h-index of Peruvian researchers,
co-authorship network (visible to a greater extent in some
specializations than in others) makes several authors
become involved in the development of a research paper.
This trend towards co-authorship has been analyzed in
previous studies that have identified it as being one factor
http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0103-37862014000200004

that influences citation of researchers (Glanzel, 2002;
Aksnes, 2003; Leimu & Koricheva, 2005).
On the other hand, although the h-index of
researchers showed no biased distribution-which made
it possible to develop the ranking of researchers with high
impact publications-it would be a risk to make a
comparative analysis based only on the h-index as this
bibliometric indicator depends, among other variables,
on the size of the research community, publication habits,
and citation patterns of each discipline.
In this regard, the researchers Rodríguez-Navarro
and Imperial-Cárdenas (2006) proposed an interesting
alternative to establish the range of the h-index values
in accordance with the different areas of knowledge. For
example, among researchers in the field of High Energy
Physics (a field with a high publication rate), a successful
author would have an h-index between 15-25, an
excellent researcher an h-index between 26-40 and an
outstanding author an h-index greater than 40. With
researchers coming from fields with publication rates not
as intensive as physicians (Psychology or Education), the
h-index of a successful author would be between 6-7,
an excellent author an h-index scoring 8-15, and a
prominent researcher an h-index greater than 15

BIBLIOMETRIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH H-INDEX

Documents

(Rodríguez-Navarro & Imperial-Cárdenas, 2006). Within
this range the h-index of researchers from related fields
can be compared and the basic principle of achievement
is that only what is comparable can be compared. Thus,
the h-index of a researcher can not be interpreted as an
absolute measure, but it depends on context, which is
given by the area or field of specialization.

152

Furthermore, to understand the impact of the hindex within the Peruvian research community, it would
be advisable to define the expected range of the h-index
values so that only one evaluation criterion would exist
for the accreditation of Education and Medicine schools,
as well as Peruvian graduate programs. The Consejo de
Evaluación, Acreditación y Certificación de la Calidad de la
Educación Superior Universitaria (CONEAU), whose
purpose is to ensure the quality of higher education, has
developed quality models for the accreditation process,
defining a comprehensive set of standards and indicators.
In these models, from almost 100 indicators, only 4-6
indicators assess scientific production of undergraduate
and graduate faculties. Even these indicators establish a
high priority to works published in indexed journals, but
they do not specify what is meant by indexed journals,
whether it only considers WoS and Scopus journals or if
journals indexed on Scientific Electronic Library Online
(SciELO) or available on Google Scholar would suffice.
No CONEAU models consider individual impact
indicators such as the h-index or any of its related indexes.
Therefore, decisions concerning faculty tenure and
promotions, as well as research funding, are solely based
on subjective opinions or social relationships between
the researcher and university authorities (dean, provost,
etc.). For this reason, it is imperative to rely on quantitative
criteria as they are less vulnerable to personal bias or
favoritism due to political affinities.

C. VÍLCHEZ-ROMÁN

With regard to the institutions, Peruvian
universities in partnership with foreign institutions
achieved the highest institutional h-index, as shown by
number of papers published due to collaborative
agreements: from 2,447 studies published by UPCH and
indexed in Scopus, 267 were published in partnership
with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
and 102 with Prins Leopold Institute voor Tropische
Geneeskunde; from 1,347 works published by UNMSM,
TransInformação, Campinas, 26(2):143-154, maio/ago., 2014

86 were conducted in collaboration with one of schools
of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University and 41 with
the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This trend
was also noted in Peruvian research centers: from 700
studies produced by CIP, 45 were published in
collaboration with the University of Wisconsin Madison
and 30 with Cornell University; in turn, from 251
documents produced by IIN, 41 were published in
partnership with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of
Public Health and 19 with the World Health Organization.
The trend toward international collaboration is
understandable because of the size and broad coverage
of the fields of knowledge and universities often carry
out many projects in cooperation with national and
international institutions. In research centers,
collaboration occurs due to the need for funding as
financial support from the state is limited. Given that
universities and research centers with a higher h-index
show a significant partnership agreements with highimpact international institutions, Peruvian universities
and research centers with a lower impact would do well
to carry out projects in collaboration with high-impact
institutions. Thus, they would not only ensure the transfer
of skills and expertise, but institutions with lower research
capacity could progressively improve their academic
impact.
Of the 180 universities in Peru, only two have an
institutional h-index greater than 40 (in WoS: UPCH 75
and UNMSM 51, in Scopus: UPCH 74 and UNMSM 43),
which means that these institutions have at least 40
publications cited at least 40 times, while the h-index
the remaining of 178 universities are under 40. This is a
huge problem as one of the core functions of a university,
in addition to professional training and social outreach,
is the production of scientific knowledge. Indeed what
distinguishes the university from other higher education
institutions, such as technical institutes, at least in Peru,
is scientific production. However, if most Peruvian
universities do not contribute to the innovation national
system, it would be desirable to redefine their purpose
so that they can direct resources toward professional
training rather than research. Although the mission of
Peruvian universities emphasizes their commitment to
the production of scientific knowledge, in practice, their
contribution to Research + Development + Innovation
is very low.

With regard to the bibliometric factors associated
with the impact of research, despite the moderate
dispersion of variables considered for analysis, model fit
achieved statistical significance even when only a few
cases were analyzed. Correlation analyses for the
institutional h-index showed different association
coefficients in WoS and Scopus. This difference between
both databases is explained due to the standardization
of the names of authors and institutions on the Scopus
database, an improvement that can be verified by using
the authors/institutions search feature. Since both
scientific databases have a high degree of similarity in
terms of indexed publications, advances such as the
standardization of authors and institutions allow Scopus
to generate more consistent results.
Given that one of the purposes of this study was
to identify the bibliometric factors with a higher influence
on the h-index of Peruvian researchers, results showed
that indexed documents and citations have a greater
effect on the publication impact of the researcher. Thus,
when authors cite an academic reference in their work,
they do not only consider which are the most cited
papers, but mainly the total production and work quality
of each researcher. This is understandable because during
the development of conceptual framework and problem
backgrounds, the researchers know which authors are
the most representative or renowned in the field (those
http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0103-37862014000200004

who are often the most productive). Therefore, when
researchers refine background and analyze the results
comparing them with previous studies, they examine
each paper in depth and identify the contributions
of more sophisticated studies, which are usually those
that achieve the highest average citation rates per
document.
With regard to the researcher’s work, these
findings show that the mantra “publish or perish” is still
important, but not sufficient. In some cases, the academic
strategy for publication focused on partnerships with
foreign institutions has worked, so it is a recommended
path for authors working to improve their academic
output and impact. Given that authors strive to produce
high quality work, rather than just publishing the largest
number of studies, their research impact will improve
steadily.

Conclusion
The approach used in this research made it
possible to identify Peruvian researchers with high and
medium academic impact (the full list does not show
authors with low impact due to limitation of space). In
order to obtain a complete picture using individual data
available in WoS, it would be advisable if the Thomson
Data Analyzer were purchased to normalize the data of
authors.
With regard to the bibliometric factors associated
with the h-index of Peruvian researchers, OLS regression
identified two variables that are highly related to the
definition of h-index: indexed documents and citations.
This initial finding can be improved if further large scale
studies include more academic variables in addition to
the institutional h-index or academic age (postgraduate
degrees in a foreign university, number of works
published in co-authorship, area of specialization, etc.).
Finally, even when both citation databases did not
show the same list of Peruvian high-impact institutions,
the approach used by the author was effective to
compare the similarities between them and confirm that
they can be used as complementary tools to monitor
and evaluate scientific production.

BIBLIOMETRIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH H-INDEX

Public Peruvian universities are not the only ones
absent from the list of centers focused on production of
science and technology; Peruvian private universities also
do not appear among the institutions with moderate
research capacity. This is a troubling issue because, in
theory, the private sector should be a key component
that streamlines national innovation systems as they do
not face the burden of bureaucracy and complex
procedures that are common in the public sector.
However, it appears that the contribution of the
private sector to R+D+I, at least with regard to the
bibliometric indicators, is almost nonexistent. This
means that the private sector does not generate scientific
and technological innovation, but mainly imports
technology from other countries, and in the area of
R+D+I it focuses primarily on implementing existing
solutions.
