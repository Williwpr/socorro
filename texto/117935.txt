Dear readers,
As I resumed the edition of the journal Transinformação, I felt compelled to thank everyone who collaborated
with the past editions and somehow shared their studies, and by example of the salt and light metaphor, gave those
who seek in specialized reading the ‘flavor’ and ‘hope’ to the answers to their scientific aspirations, or ‘fed their minds’
with new ideas and paradigms. I hope I can count on everyone again.
In hopes of extending this partnership, Transinformação’s editorial and publishing center reaffirms the mission
proposed: to issue a scientific periodical committed to quality, periodicity, and innovative vision.
In the last years, Transinformação has produced important achievements: it is indexed in the Web of
Science, JCR Social Science, SciELO, Scopus, Latindex, and Clase; it has an impact factor (IF) of 0.083 and is
classified as A1 by Qualis/Capes; it is also available in full at the Portal of Scientific Periodicals PUC-Campinas at
http://www.puc-campinas.edu.br/periodicocientifico and constitutes the institutional Repositories: RI-UFF; UnB;
RIUnB.
For 2014 we present an edition based on the “VII International Seminar about Qualitative and Quantitative
Studies on Science and Technology,” and we hope that this initiative will strengthen the area of Information Science in
our country.
May everyone greatly enjoy reading our editions!
